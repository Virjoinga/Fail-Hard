<entry name="CUTSCENE_WINGS_1">Hey, Jacky boy! Look what my item provider found got from the dump-erm, from the army equipment sale. </entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_PV50_BROKEN_2">Right, that’s it, I’m taking it back for repairs.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL1_1">Alright, my old moped still runs and the ramp is in place. Let’s see if I can pull off some cool jumps and flips.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL1_2"> I can almost imagine the exact spots where I want to get.</entry>
<entry name="DO_YOU_WANT_TO_UPGRADE">Do you want to \nupgrade?</entry>
<entry name="REMAINING">remaining</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_WINGS_6">Don’t worry, Jacky boy, this is a great and absolutely safe deal!</entry>
<entry name="COINS">coins:</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_HELMET_6">Hey Jacky! Come here for a second! My provider has another great deal for you!</entry>
<entry name="THEME_BEACH">Beach</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL2_SUCCESS_1">Woo, what a rush! And the landing hurt less than I thought! ...little bit less anyway.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_WINGS_3">I bet you could even maneuver yourself into those tricky spots you couldn’t reach before.</entry>
<entry name="NEW_LEVEL_UNLOCKED">New level unlocked!</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_WINGS_5">Oh, absolutely! And they are just -ahemcough-illion dollars.</entry>
<entry name="COOL_NEW_STUFF">Cool new stuff available!</entry>
<entry name="CONNECTING">Connecting</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL3_SUCCESS_2">Impressive work, sport! Alright, I’m the talent manager for local TV and I need a new star after our last one -ahem- took an extended vacation. Interested?</entry>
<entry name="GAME_TITLE">Fail Hard</entry>
<entry name="SORRY_IM_BUSY">Sorry, I&apos;m busy!</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_WINGS_4">Yeah, they look impressive, but... Do they really work? And how much do they cost anyway?</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_PV50_BROKEN_1">Sigh… Do I even want to know what you’ve done to my beautiful moped?</entry>
<entry name="FIX_PERMANENTLY">Fix permanently?</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_PV50_BROKEN_3">Aw, man… Well, it’ll be a quick fix, right?</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_PV50_BROKEN_4">Yeah, no, this going to take a while. Have fun riding your rusty junk pile.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_HELMET_3">Well, if you need reasons… It’s much easier to stay on the moped and even blast through things with some heavy-duty protection.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_HELMET_4">Besides, you remember what happened to the last guy who didn’t wear a helmet, don’t you?</entry>
<entry name="TO_COMPLETE">to complete</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_WINGS_2">Folding glider wings, just the thing you need for long jumps.</entry>

<entry name="THEME_BACKYARD">Backyard</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_ROCKET_3">It sure is! This beauty packs enough power to get you and your moped to places where you could never get on your own. Just a hop and up you go!</entry>
<entry name="HIGHSCORE">highscore:</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_ROCKET_5">No worries, my buddy promised this on a bargain and he’ll even throw in the first tanks of gas for free.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_ROCKET_6">Refills cost though, but this isn’t charity, you know.</entry>
<entry name="YOUR_MOPED_IS_FIXED">Your moped is fixed!</entry>
<entry name="LOADING">Loading</entry>
<entry name="UPGRADE_READY">Upgrade ready!</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_WINGS_7">Great and safe for me at least... heh heh heh...</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL1_SUCCESS_1">Yes! Right on target! Heh, I bet I could become a stuntman with these skills.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_HELMET_1">My provider is trying really hard to sell me this old helmet, but Jacky boy has been doing fine without a helmet so far. Why would he need one now? </entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_HELMET_2">And the fans want to see the handsome face of their hero, not some dull helmet, you know.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_STAGE1_COMPLETED_1">So you are the manager’s new pet project... He said you needed a better moped.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_STAGE1_COMPLETED_2">And for once he wasn’t exaggerating. I don’t think that junkpile can even fall apart anymore...</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_STAGE1_COMPLETED_3">Hey, is that a real Hando Ape? Awesome! Do I get to ride that in my stunts?</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_STAGE1_COMPLETED_4">Yes and unfortunately yes…</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_STAGE1_COMPLETED_5">But if, or more accurately, when you break it, you’re going straight back to your junk moped until I fix it.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_WELCOME_TO_GARAGE_2">Great! Where can I spend my money?</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_ROCKET_4">Sounds handy, but aren’t these things really expensive?</entry>
<entry name="STAGE_COMPLETED">Stage completed!</entry>
<entry name="INSTALL">Install!</entry>
<entry name="SORRY_ITS_LOCKED">Sorry, it&apos;s locked.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL3_1">Hey, sport! I’ve been watching your stunts and gotta say I like what I see. Tell you what, I’ve got a deal for you…</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL3_2">But! First you have to blow my mind. Up for it?</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL3_3">Okay, you’re on! Now watch this!</entry>
<entry name="SKIP_OR_WAIT">Do you want to upgrade instantly or wait?</entry>
<entry name="LETS_FIX_YOUR_MOPED">Let&apos;s fix your moped.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_WELCOME_TO_GARAGE_1">Welcome to the garage. This is where the magic happens.</entry>
<entry name="NOT_ENOUGH_MONEY">Not enough money.</entry>
<entry name="FIX_IT">Fix it?</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_ROCKET_1">Jacky, my boy, now we hit the jackpot! Look what my provider sto-erm managed to get for us!</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_PV50_FIXED_1">There we go, my beautiful vehicle is a s good as new. I would tell you to be careful, but you stuntmen never listen.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_PV50_FIXED_2">Finally! I hate to complain, but… Can’t you make it, I dunno, not break so easily?</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_PV50_FIXED_3">Well, I could upgrade it with indestructible titanium parts, but you’d have to pay the bill. You’re the one always wrecking things anyway.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL2_1">Those last jumps were fun, but I want to get even higher and reach those spots where my moped can’t get.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL2_2">Heh, and I know just the thing to do...</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL3_SUCCESS_1">There, how about that? Definitely my best stunt so far.</entry>
<entry name="WAIT">Wait</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL3_SUCCESS_3">Me? A TV star? You bet I’m interested! When do I start?</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL3_SUCCESS_4">Right now, my boy. You just need to sign one little contract and I’ll get you everything you need for your stunts.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_TUTORIAL3_SUCCESS_5">I even know a mechanic who can help you and a trusty equipment provider who can deal you sweet gadgets at reasonable price.</entry>
<entry name="NO">No</entry>
<entry name="SCORE">score:</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_ROCKET_2">Hey, is that a real rocketpack? I thought only the pros could get those.</entry>
<entry name="CUTSCENE_HELMET_5">... On a second thought, the helmet is a great idea, almost as great as my ideas.</entry>
